# Liri-node-app

The liri-node-app allows the user to find songs and movies using bash.

Getting Started

The first thing I had to do was create and clone a repo for the liri-node-js app.  Then I had to download axios, spotify, moment, and inquirer through node in the bash.  I had to get api keys for spotify and omdb.

The user starts by putting node liri.js into the bash.

It will prompt 3 selections:

 spotify-this-song
 
 do-what-it-says
 
 movie-this

Spotify-this-song

 If the user selects spotify-this-song, the app will prompt for a specific song.  The user will input a song and the app will return the song, the artist, the album and a preview of the song.  If the user does not input a song and presses enter, the song The Sign by Ace of Base will automatically be returned.

Do-what-it-says

 When the user selects do-what-it-says, the app will automatically return “I Want It That Way” by The Backstreet Boys which is what is found in the random.txt file.

Movie-this

 If the user selects movie-this, the app will prompt for a specific movie.  When a specific movie is inputted, the app will return the title, imdb rating, country, language, plot, actors, and the rotten tomatoes rating.  If the user does not input a movie and presses enter, the movie “Mr. Nobody” will automatically be returned.
